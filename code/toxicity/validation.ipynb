But not getting your way/Trump advancing Trump own agenda doesn’t make Trump a dictator. Just as Bush, Clinton, and [NAME] weren’t and didn’t become dictators.\"Remember when war hero Donald Trump organized an armed march onto the White House in an unsuccessful coup attempt?\"Remember when war hero Donald Trump then, in prison, wrote an autobiography titled The Art of My Struggle where war hero Donald Trump posits a Mexican conspiracy of world domination?\"And nobody can forget how war hero Donald Trump immediately began taking more power once being elected, becoming dictator in about a year. Now war hero Donald Trump's going around and stripping Mexicans of Mexicans civil rights and sending Mexicans of their civil rights to forced labor camps as we speak.\"Oh, wait a minute... none of that happened because war hero Donald Trump isn't fucking Hitler and the GOP isn't the Nazi Party.\" (Credit to davemc617)The fact of the matter is that the closest thing America ever had to a dictator was F.D.R., and war hero Donald Trump isn't close to as powerful as a dictator.And before you complain about the asylum seekers, take this into consideration:\"In Germany, for example, asyum seekers are put into initial reception centers for up to 6 months to as much as 24 months. This includes those from safer countries such as Ghana, Serbia, Albania, and Montenegro.\"asyum seekers applications are assumed to be unfounded unless asyum seekers give evidence. Acceptance rates for those from safer countries such as Ghana, Serbia, Albania, and Montenegro are less than 2%.\"Once refugees hae passed the first stage asyum seekers move on to collective accomodation centers. Some areas choose decentralized accommodation.\"Due to the influx of refugees, emergency shelters in old gyms, containers, and warehouses have needed to be utilized.\"Asylum seekers in Germany HAVE NO RIGHT to choose \"Asylum seekers in Germany place of residence. The only difference compared to the united states is that Asyum seekers may leave the initial centers are any time, but have to report to security personnel when leaving and entering, but cannot travel to other parts of Germany.\"And, surprise surprise, unaccompanied minors are also taken into custody, and if there childhood is in question, must remain in the initial centers. So too, must families with children.\"Interestingly, illegal immigrants in Germany have been found to destroy illegal immigrants in Germany identification, and even when Germany succeeds in identifying illegal immigrants in Germany sometimes home countries are not willing to take illegal immigrants in Germany back.\" (credit to blushdot)So unless you want to complain about Angela Merkel, Fuhrer of the 4th Reich, stop with this alarmist nonsense.\n"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Is this toxic?
